Witness: the coverage matrix shows zero missing and zero stale cells for class ∈ {optimal, secondary} × measurement ∈ {runtime, breakdown} for this campaign's likelihoods; every new current cell carries fit.png, provenance and parity.json; `build_catalogue --check --validate-with ../PyAutoPulse` valid at @3; the campaign wiki page records the pre-registered rule and verdict

Phase 2 sub-issue 2f of the `likelihood-lifecycle` epic (report §4 "Phase 2"; ledger "Phase 2" card). Depends on phase 0 (complete) and phase 1B (merged, autolens_profiling#453); start after autolens_profiling#455 (follow-ups) merges. Scope: multi_dataset and datacube/delaunay (40 planned cells).



## Rules (every phase-2 sub-issue; epic ledger "Phase 2" card)
- The coverage matrix (`python scripts/misc/tooling/coverage_matrix.py` → `dashboard/coverage.md`) names this campaign's missing and stale cells; those cells are the work list.
- Every cell is measured at the standard size (Delaunay 1250, rectangular 35² = 1225; human ruling 2026-10-23) on a pinned released tag, from a private RAL checkout (never the shared mirror). CPU arrays go on `--partition=ral` only; A100 runs use `--gres`. **The human gives a go for each RAL batch.** Never touch another campaign's jobs.
- Every cell lands as `current`, carrying runtime and breakdown, provenance, `fit.png` (phase 1B renders it automatically) and a `parity.json` against a reference log-likelihood. Prior rows on the key become `superseded` through the catalogue builder.
- A campaign page at the mirrored wiki path (`wiki/campaigns/<dataset_type>/<variant>/`) records the rule and the expected verdict before the runs, then the result.
- Pulse receipt refetched after merge. Phase 2 ends only on the human's "campaigns complete" confirmation (the gate for phase 3).
