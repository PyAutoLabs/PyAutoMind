  - PyAutoFit (branch feature/multistart-quick-update-49-steps)
- summary: |
    Investigated: MultiStartProdigy cannot stop at a quick-update boundary — the
    multi-start step loop never reads iterations_per_quick_update and the
    convergence gate (min_steps=100) plus the n_steps ceiling are the only stop
    paths (empirically confirmed: cadence=50, n_steps=120 runs 120/120). The
    reported "49 steps" is search.summary's `Total Samples = 49` line
    (1 best + n_starts=48 per-start finals) misread as a step count. Fix:
    report Total Steps / Stop Reason in the multi-start search.summary block,
    disambiguate the Total Samples line, and pin the non-termination with an
    end-to-end MultiStartProdigy regression test (the prompt's Witness).
    PR #1555 CI green on head 2629933cc; merge serially before
    autofit-multistart-iterations per the batch record.

- summary: |
    Repair the PyAutoMemory queue automation (#69/#71/#72 stuck since
    2026-08-28): add the PyAutoBrain sibling checkout to queue_filing.yml
    (gate hard-broken since dcd1e2c, 2026-08-24), make queue_actions.yml's
    push retry conflict-proof (fetch + reset --hard + re-run the idempotent
    action script instead of rebase-and-discard), and add an if: failure()
    report step so a failed run comments on its issue instead of silence.
    Close-out post-merge (human): re-apply labels on #69/#71/#72; Witness =
    green queue_filing.yml run on #71 that opens a filing PR.

    Phase 2 of numpy-deflections-cpu: scipy.special.wofz on the numpy branch of the MGE
    Faddeeva, Gaussian.wofz deduped onto MGEDecomposer.wofz, numpy-only spherical MGE branch
    (removes the q=0.9999 clamp bias), exact exp_term mask; cache lever dropped (0.3 %).
    Re-pin of dark/stellar lens cells with mpmath provenance. Targets re-scoped to measured
    ceilings (gNFW ~2.3x, gNFWSph ~59x, Gaussian sph ~16x). Fable session; execution → Opus.
