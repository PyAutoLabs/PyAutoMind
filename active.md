## numba-vs-jax-sparse
- issue: https://github.com/PyAutoLabs/PyAutoArray/issues/513
- issued: 2026-08-31
- status: awaiting-input (verdict posted 2026-08-31; judge-tier research — parks
  for human review per the supervised contract; sign-off retires via close-out,
  a failed review files an ordinary /intake follow-up)
- question: https://github.com/PyAutoLabs/PyAutoArray/issues/513#issuecomment-5483142802
- heart-ack:
  - manifest drift: local checkout origins — 1 mismatch(es) vs PyAutoMind/repos.yaml
  - CI status unavailable for all 6 libraries and 11 workspaces (web container: Heart's ci_status.sh shells to gh, which does not exist here — measurement blindness, not a measured red)
- repos:
  - PyAutoArray: main (read-only — research verdict, no branch)
- summary: |
    Is the numba CPU positive-only solve the same linear algebra as the JAX
    sparse-operator mode? Characterise the shipped numba lineage (#498/#501
    warm-start memo, #505/#507 curvature-F work, SparseLinAlgImagingNumba
    preload) against the JAX ImagingSparseOperator + jaxnnls PDIP path; assess
    GPU-portability of the numba levers; verdict unify/port/keep posted on the
    issue. Judge-tier: verdict parks for human review, no decide-and-flag.

## subhalo-followup-adapt-split-rectangular
- issue: none — science project (no GitHub home; not in repos.yaml); review via the
  next batch packet per the science-run review workflow (batches/reviews/2026-08-31-am.md)
- issued: 2026-08-31
- status: science-run (supervised --auto; human-dispatched from the 2026-08-31-am
  batch review's queued tweaks)
- location: cli-in-progress
- repos:
  - subhalo_validation (local, /mnt/c/Users/Jammy/Science/subhalo_validation, branch main — no worktree; project has no remote)
- summary: |
    Three actions from the 2026-08-31-am review rulings (project state.md "Next
    session — 2026-08-31" items 2–4), in order:
    1. `_adapt_split_fix` rerun — source_pix[1] on pl_eff_1_outer with AdaptSplit
       replacing ConstantSplit at pix[1], output suffix `_adapt_split_fix`; run only
       through source_pix[1], NO later stages chained — human inspects first.
       Scope the reg swap as an explicit knob/variant, not a silent default change
       to the delaunay_adapt_split recipe.
    2. Disable subhalo[2] (single-plane refine) for future runs — subhalo[1] grid
       detection suffices; keep visibly commented for a paper-run re-enable.
    3. RectangularBilinear runs (rectangular_adapt recipe, job A reloads / job B
       fresh via hpc/run_chain.sh) for the two successful lenses: pl_sersic_0 +
       whichever pl_eff of 342027_1/_2 lands cleanly — confirm from pulled witness
       JSONs before submitting; if pl_eff is still running/undetermined, submit
       pl_sersic_0 and park the pl_eff member as a recorded follow-up.
    Constraints: two-job JAX/numba split mandatory; RAL CPU partition `ral`; submit
    from hpc/batch_cpu; size --time from measured stage costs (grid ≈29h of ≈34h);
    commit edits locally on main; journal run rows + rewrite wiki/project/state.md.
    Pulled outputs land at the next batch collect (runs outlast this session).
