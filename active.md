- summary: |
    Rename the 10 `aplt.subplot_fit_dirty_images(` calls (9 interferometer
    scripts; re-verified on main 30104f6 — the prompt said 11) to the
    autolens-bound `aplt.subplot_fit_interferometer_dirty_images(`, which
    overlays auto-derived critical curves on the dirty model image. Update the
    4 docstring mentions; the plots.yaml key reference in plot.py stays.
    Regenerate the 9 notebooks. Supervised because the figures change: a human
    eyeballs one regenerated figure before merge.

- summary: |
    Campaign, not a one-shot: ~6 passes of ~15 prompts over the 89 unwitnessed
    `Unattended: ready` drafts. Each pass proposes candidate witnesses for the
    human to accept/edit/strike, then writes three header fields per accepted
    prompt — `Witness:`, `Consequence:`, `Review-minutes:`. The three-field
    rewrite is load-bearing: 74 of the 89 already declare `Consequence: judge`
    (a cached derivation from intake's hygiene set), and the precedence rule
    lets that stale value beat the witness, so a witness written alone moves
    nothing. Baseline 2026-09-10, derived over the 110 ready prompts:
    5 notify / 12 glance / 93 judge; fully witnessed the same set grades
    28 notify / 74 glance / 8 judge.
    Pass 1 (`workspaces`, 15) SHIPPED 2026-09-10: 15 judge -> 7 notify /
    8 glance / 0 judge, 300 seed review-minutes -> 24. Backlog now 109 ready,
    36 witnessed, derived 12 notify / 19 glance / 78 judge.
    Pass 2 (`autoarray`, 11) SHIPPED 2026-09-17: 10 judge / 1 glance ->
    1 notify / 9 glance / 1 judge, 173 seed review-minutes -> 47; first
    `Witness: none —` (multiwavelength_inversion). Backlog now 157 ready,
    72 witnessed + 1 none, derived 18 notify / 44 glance / 95 judge.
    Follow-up for the Brain: the sizing faculty has no `none` rule (reads
    `Witness: none —` as a witness). Pass 3 (`autofit`, 26) SHIPPED 2026-09-17:
    24 judge / 2 notify -> 3 notify / 20 glance / 3 judge, 465 -> 130 seed
    review-minutes. Backlog now 157 ready, 83 witnessed + 3 none,
    derived 19 notify / 55 glance / 83 judge.
    Pass 4 (`autolens`, 11) SHIPPED 2026-09-17 (pre-accepted): 11 judge ->
    10 glance / 1 judge, 230 -> 55 seed review-minutes. Backlog now
    157 ready, 94 witnessed + 3 none, derived 20 notify /
    64 glance / 73 judge. Next: autolens_workspace (7), euclid (6),
    autogalaxy (5), autolens_profiling (5), tail (~30 singletons).
    Pass-by-pass counts are in the prompt's `## Campaign log`.

## sed-chain-cpu-route
- issue: https://github.com/PyAutoLabs/euclid_strong_lens_modeling_pipeline/issues/69
- issued: 2026-09-11
- prompt: active/sed_chain_cpu_route_jax_cpu_backend.md
- session: claude --resume session_01AELxUSfSPRz2SDnnVJHohi
- status: awaiting-merge
- worktree: ~/Code/PyAutoLabs-wt/sed-chain-cpu-route
- repos:
  - euclid_strong_lens_modeling_pipeline: feature/sed-chain-cpu-route
- workspace-pr: https://github.com/PyAutoLabs/euclid_strong_lens_modeling_pipeline/pull/70
- note: worktree_check_conflict flagged euclid_strong_lens_modeling_pipeline as claimed by remove-fits-dataset-plots-yaml, whose PR #63 merged and issue #62 closed on 2026-09-10 without a close-out. Stale claim, waived on the human's plan approval; the file sets are disjoint (hpc/ submit scripts and README here, config/visualize/plots.yaml there) and this task runs in a fresh parallel worktree.
- summary: |
    The SED chain (Sersic VIS + per-band waveband fits) gets a CPU submit script,
    hpc/batch_cpu/submit_sersic_waveband, which pins JAX to the CPU backend exactly as
    stage 1 of submit_initial_lens_model_two_stage does for vis_lp (no --use_cpu: both SED
    analyses are use_jax=True and --use_cpu would flip them to Numba). It becomes the
    documented default; the GPU script stays as the optional route. README route table,
    hpc/sync comments and usage text, the sersic_lens_model.py batch_size docstring and the
    PyAutoCortex "Where to look" line are repointed. GPU job 342648 is untouched.

## sersic-variants

- repos:
  - euclid_strong_lens_modeling_pipeline: feature/sersic-variants
- workspace-pr: https://github.com/PyAutoLabs/euclid_strong_lens_modeling_pipeline/pull/75
- note: "worktree_check_conflict sersic-variants euclid_strong_lens_modeling_pipeline exits 1 on two claims. remove-fits-dataset-plots-yaml is stale (PR #63 merged, issue #62 closed 2026-09-10, no close-out). sed-chain-cpu-route is LIVE (PR #70 open) and its file set genuinely overlaps: hpc/README.md route table (both add rows to the same table — a one-line resolution expected on whichever merges second) and scripts/sersic_lens_model.py (its only hunk there is a two-line batch_size docstring edit at ~250, clear of the model block extracted here). Waived on the human's plan approval, in a fresh parallel worktree — the same call sed-chain-cpu-route itself recorded against remove-fits-dataset-plots-yaml."
- summary: |
    --variant for the Sersic stage: four variants (baseline, wide_n,
    central_noise, sersic_point) on the same 100 euclid_sersics core lenses, to
    explain the lens-light Sersic index pile-up at the n = 5 prior edge. The
    inline model block in fit_sersic is extracted into a pure sersic_model_from
    helper; variant=None stays byte-for-byte today's behaviour and any other
    variant writes to unique_tag sersic_lens_model_<variant>. util gains a pure
    Gaussian noise-inflation helper (A = 9, sigma = 0.17") plus a keyword-only
    noise_inflation on load_vis_dataset, and parse_fit_args(with_variant=True).
    New hpc/batch_cpu/submit_sersic_variants runs the four variants sequentially
    inside one array task per lens, because all four restore the same vis_lp zip
    and PyAutoFit's restore() deletes it. Science-clone submit and the analysis
    script (PR 2) are follow-ups.

## sersic-variants-analysis

- status: workspace-dev
- worktree: n/a — web-github session clone (/home/user/euclid_strong_lens_modeling_pipeline); the local ~/Code/PyAutoLabs-wt/sersic-variants-analysis worktree named on 2026-09-12 never pushed feature/sersic-variants-analysis, so the branch of record is the session's
- repos:
  - euclid_strong_lens_modeling_pipeline: claude/sersic-variants-analysis-3iqibr
- resume: "IMPLEMENTED 2026-09-17 (web-github; Fable planned, Opus executed): claude/sersic-variants-analysis-3iqibr pushed at 480c107 — scripts/analysis/{sersic_variants.py,README.md,__init__.py}, tests/test_sersic_variants_analysis.py (8 tests), one config/build/no_run.yaml entry. Verified locally: the new tests + test_repo_invariants + test_compare_catalogues, 26 passed; the rest of the fast suite needs astropy/autolens (absent in the container) — CI runs it. FLAGGED on issue #76 comment 5715176814: the W1-W4 thresholds are transcribed into the module's WITNESSES constant (plan page rev 3 unreachable from the session) and need the human's confirmation. NEXT = /ship_workspace (PR) then /prm; nothing here imports --variant, so PR #75's merge order is not a gate."
- note: "worktree_check_conflict sersic-variants-analysis euclid_strong_lens_modeling_pipeline exits 1 on three claims. remove-fits-dataset-plots-yaml is stale (PR #63 merged, issue #62 closed 2026-09-10, no close-out). sed-chain-cpu-route (PR #70) and sersic-variants (PR #75) are live, but neither file set intersects this one: this task adds only scripts/analysis/** (new tree), tests/test_sersic_variants_analysis.py (new) and one line in config/build/no_run.yaml, which neither touches. Its documentation deliberately goes in a new scripts/analysis/README.md rather than scripts/README.md or catalogue/README.md, which belong to PR #75's diff. Waived on the human's plan approval, in a fresh parallel worktree based on origin/main - the same call sed-chain-cpu-route itself recorded against remove-fits-dataset-plots-yaml."
- summary: |
    PR 2 of the euclid_sersics variants work: scripts/analysis/sersic_variants.py
    reads the four lens_sersic_<variant>.csv scrapes that PR #75's --variant
    produces and emits the per-variant comparison production needs - N, median n,
    fractions above 4.5/4.9/9.5 (and 5.0 for wide_n), paired dn and dR_eff against
    baseline with 16-84 % bands, June-vs-baseline dn from sample/lens_map.csv, and
    the four witness readings W1-W4 printed as numbers beside their pre-registered
    thresholds, never as a verdict word. Four-panel shared-bin histogram PNG plus a
    markdown report. Pure functions split from the CLI; a synthetic four-CSV
    fixture with a variant missing two tiles pins the inner join and its reporting.

    Prompt's defect REFUTED twice (2026-08-21, 2026-09-15): all 4
    modeling_visualization_jit scripts pass from cleared output under
    profile_release on current main (8/8 passes, libraries moved 58-186 commits
    between gates). Only residual is the stale point_source/visualization parking
    (autolens_workspace_test config/build/no_run.yaml:30, "exceeds 300s" -
    measured 168 s / 202 s locally, margin narrowing). PLAN ONLY, NOT STARTED:
    the human deferred execution on 2026-09-15; no worktree, no branch, no code
    change. Resume = /start_workspace, push the empty branch, dispatch retime.yml
    (point_source/visualization/modeling_visualization_jit.py, 5x, 300 s cap),
    then settle the marker FROM the measurement (all under cap -> unpark; any
    over -> keep parked with the measured #274-style verdict). One-line
    workspace PR; close-out record says "no defect exists to fix" like siblings
    PyAutoFit#1508 / PyAutoArray#467. Incidental: "Visualization warm-up failed
    (non-fatal)" swallowed in autofit fitness.py for ellipse + point_source -
    separate prompt draft/bug/autofit/visualization_warmup_swallowed_exception.md.
