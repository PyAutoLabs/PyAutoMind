## workspace-config-cleanup
- issue: https://github.com/PyAutoLabs/PyAutoMind/issues/441
- issued: 2026-09-27
- prompt: active/workspace_config_cleanup.md
- epic: organ-cockpit
- session: Claude Code CLI (Opus 5.5 main session + Opus subagent), 2026-09-27; session ID unavailable
- status: awaiting-release (6/7 merged 2026-09-27: Galaxy#630 cbd89ced, Lens#751 1e6372fd, Nerves#176 0b6e7c78, autofit_ws#164 aa7361df, autogalaxy_ws#250 7fd1953d, autocti_ws#34 7aa79ac6; autolens_workspace#578 OPEN, held for the PyAutoGalaxy release)
- autonomy: supervised (header); plan approved in-session 2026-09-27 (library-first: Nerves board equivalence + allow-list, PyAutoGalaxy promotion, then workspace deletes)
- worktree: ~/Code/PyAutoLabs-wt/workspace-config-cleanup
- parallel-claim: "PyAutoNerves is also claimed by eyes-organ-order (PyAutoMind#439), whose Nerves diff is only AGENTS.md; this task touches only scripts/board.py + its tests. Parallel worktree human-approved 2026-09-27; noted on #439 and #441."

- release-gate: PyAutoGalaxy
- resume: "6/7 merged. Once PyAutoGalaxy (with #630) is on PyPI: /prm autolens_workspace#578, then full close-out (records, issue #441 close, worktree removal). Nerves board re-dispatched after merge."

## vis-lp-inspection-bundle
- issue: https://github.com/PyAutoLabs/euclid_strong_lens_modeling_pipeline/issues/102
- issued: 2026-09-22
- session: claude (Fable CLI, 2026-09-23; resumed from Codex 2026-09-22)
- status: workspace-dev
- worktree: /home/jammy/Code/PyAutoLabs/.worktrees/vis-lp-inspection-bundle
- repos:
  - euclid_strong_lens_modeling_pipeline: feature/vis-lp-inspection-bundle
- summary: Add an explicit vis_lp-only inspection mode that combines the main normal-model output tree with the 100-lens SED/Sersic tree, without requiring vis_pix or selecting the other 200 main-tree lenses.
- resume: Implemented + committed locally as c6b514d on feature/vis-lp-inspection-bundle (133 tests green, not pushed). Human reviews diff (scratchpad part1_diff.txt) before ship_workspace; then sync tooling to the euclid_dr1 science clone/RAL and submit the 4,922-tile vis_lp-only bundle (OUTPUT_DIR=dr1_full, INITIAL_SEARCH_NAME=vis_lp, DATASET_NAMES_PATH=all, TAR_TO set) as a Cortex run.
