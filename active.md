- prompt: active/interferometer_decision_matrix.md
- epic: interferometer-likelihood-campaign
- session: Claude Code CLI (Opus 5.5 main session + Opus subagent), 2026-09-30
- status: workspace-dev
- autonomy: supervised (header); plan approved in-session 2026-09-30 via Plan Mode (workspace-only, no library edits)
- parallel-claim: "autolens_profiling is also claimed by raw-pdip-forward-polish (workspace-pending). File sets disjoint (this task: instruments/interferometer.py, new hpc/batch_{cpu,gpu}/submit_breakdown_interferometer_*_{radius_gaps,sdp81}_*, new results/breakdown/interferometer/** JSONs, results/notes/interferometer_likelihood_decision_matrix_2026_09.md, wiki/campaigns/interferometer_likelihood.md, wiki/index.md row, results/README.md Campaign findings paragraph; raw-pdip: results/notes/linear_solver_accuracy_2026_09.md, wiki/campaigns/linear_solver_accuracy.md, euclid_latent.py). Whichever ships second merges results/README.md. Parallel claim human-approved 2026-09-30 with the plan."

## vis-lp-inspection-bundle
- issue: https://github.com/PyAutoLabs/euclid_strong_lens_modeling_pipeline/issues/102
- issued: 2026-09-22
- session: claude (Fable CLI, 2026-09-23; resumed from Codex 2026-09-22)
- status: workspace-dev
- worktree: /home/jammy/Code/PyAutoLabs/.worktrees/vis-lp-inspection-bundle
- repos:
  - euclid_strong_lens_modeling_pipeline: feature/vis-lp-inspection-bundle
- summary: Add an explicit vis_lp-only inspection mode that combines the main normal-model output tree with the 100-lens SED/Sersic tree, without requiring vis_pix or selecting the other 200 main-tree lenses.
- resume: Implemented + committed locally as c6b514d on feature/vis-lp-inspection-bundle (133 tests green, not pushed). Human reviews diff (scratchpad part1_diff.txt) before ship_workspace; then sync tooling to the euclid_dr1 science clone/RAL and submit the 4,922-tile vis_lp-only bundle (OUTPUT_DIR=dr1_full, INITIAL_SEARCH_NAME=vis_lp, DATASET_NAMES_PATH=all, TAR_TO set) as a Cortex run.

## heart-dashboard-clarity
- worktree: /home/jammy/Code/PyAutoLabs/.worktrees/heart-dashboard-clarity
- issue: https://github.com/PyAutoLabs/PyAutoHeart/issues/245
- issued: 2026-09-30
- session: Codex; session ID unavailable
- status: library-shipped, awaiting-merge
- library-pr: https://github.com/PyAutoLabs/PyAutoHeart/pull/246
- commit: ff05733e435d34a4c71b8432326d3c8f22bf1bfd
- repos:
  - PyAutoHeart: feature/heart-dashboard-clarity
- heart-red-override:
  - authorization: Human said "yes go" after being asked to authorize this dashboard task despite the two reported RED reasons; development only, not merge or release.
  - reasons: "PyAutoLens: 2 commit(s) behind origin"; "release validation FAILED (stage integrate)"
  - validation: 1070 Heart tests and 53 Brain consumer tests passed; Chromium mobile/desktop, clipboard failure/success, keyboard, long names and 200% text passed; in-session implementation review, Fable plan review.
  - current-red: "release validation FAILED (stage integrate)"; refreshed 2026-09-30T19:26:02.791148+00:00, score 45. Behind-origin reasons cleared by fast-forwarding clean canonical main checkouts.
- resume: PR A #246 open, pending-release label verified; no merge authorized. On human merge, dispatch heart-health.yml; then start approved PR B from draft/feature/pyautoheart/heart_dashboard_clarity_p2.md. PR C follows B.
- evidence: worktree root holds heart-tests.log, dashboard-tests.log, brain-consumer-tests.log, browser-checks.log, preview.html, preview-390.png and preview-1280.png.
