- preview: /mnt/c/Users/Jammy/Workspace/Science/scratch/three_autos_public_framing_2026-11-12/revised_introductions.html

- heart-red-override:
  authorization: live user approved development-only override for #832, commit/push/open PRs; follow-up explicitly "Open PRs and merge Lens/Galaxy after checks pass". No release.
  reasons: ["PyAutoLens: 1 uncommitted source change(s)", "PyAutoLens: 6 commit(s) behind origin", "install verification FAILED (testpypi; checks F)", "release validation FAILED (stage integrate)"]
  gates: four-file scope, exact titles, CommonMark/Sphinx excerpt rendering, diff checks and author review pass; runtime tests/smoke not applicable to prose-only edits; required CI must pass before merge.
