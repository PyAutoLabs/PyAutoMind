## jwst-frame-feasibility
- issue: https://github.com/PyAutoLabs/PyAutoReduce/issues/23
- session: claude --resume 4bf88e6b-682d-4590-906f-77b68d059b26
- status: research — delta audit + literature scan; deliverable = docs/design/jwst.md go/no-go note
- autonomy: supervised effective (--auto chain 2026-07-10); go/no-go recommendation is the checkpoint
- heart-ack: same 6-reason set as prior entries this chain; any new reason parks
- worktree: none (analysis on PyAutoReduce main; branch feature/jwst-frame-feasibility only at ship)
- repos:

## pyautoscientist-phase3a
- issue: https://github.com/PyAutoLabs/PyAutoBrain/issues/71
- status: in-progress — spawn spec + template family seed (PyAutoProject/autoproject_workspace/autoproject_workspace_test, created PRIVATE, flip-public parked) + 3b prompt drafts + Nerves role promotion; design = docs/pyautobrain/pyautoscientist_phase3_research.md, four calls human-locked 2026-07-10
- autonomy: supervised effective (--auto launched 2026-07-10 "go --auto"; feature/large cap; plan on issue; judgment gates park as batched questions on #71)
- heart-ack: the 6-reason YELLOW set acked twice in-session 2026-07-10 (workspace validation 3-failed / 58 stale parked / assistant pinned behind / Mind PR 10d / install verification / release validation); binds to exactly that set
- note: Mind work = direct-to-main docs/prompts (registry-adjacent precedent); template repos are NEW (no claims, no live surface); zero organ-code diffs; Fable deadline 2026-07-12 drives judgment-first ordering
- worktree: none (Mind docs direct; new repos cloned to scratch)

## rectangular-kernel-cdf-mesh
- issue: https://github.com/PyAutoLabs/PyAutoArray/issues/373
- library-pr: https://github.com/PyAutoLabs/PyAutoArray/pull/374
- status: workspace-dev — library leg DONE on PR#374 (pending-release; 892 tests green; function-level JAX sanity eager==JIT 1e-13, AD==FD ~5e-10; Heart YELLOW 6-reason set acked in-session at ship); stash@{0} preamble DONE (rejected, parked.md retired, decision on issue); NOW = jax_grad certification (strict FD ALL params, imaging os_pix=1+4 + interferometer sparse + eager-vs-JIT + FoM parity few e-4) + developer README rows — certification gates PR#374 merge
- autonomy: supervised effective (--auto continued in-session 2026-07-10 after human plan approval + library-ship sign-off; human directed "continue --auto" → proceed to PR-open, merge stays human)
- heart-ack: in-session 2026-07-10 — exact set: workspace validation not passing (3 failed 2026-07-09T09-48-30Z); 58 stale parked scripts; autolens_assistant pinned BEHIND installed; PyAutoMind open PR 10d old; install verification not run; no release validation for current source. Binds to exactly this set; any new reason parks.
- claim-override: human-directed 2026-07-10 — proceeds alongside rect-adapt's PyAutoArray claim ("distinct hunks, they don't clash"); coordinate merge order at ship
- note: same-file adjacency with parked rect-adapt wt (#372, uncommitted, edges_transformed hunk only) — distinct hunks in mesh_geometry/rectangular.py, clean merge either order; workspace leg (autolens_workspace_test jax_grad + autolens_workspace_developer README row) follows library PR

## rect-adapt
- issue: https://github.com/PyAutoLabs/PyAutoArray/issues/372
- session: claude --resume 4bf88e6b-682d-4590-906f-77b68d059b26
- status: awaiting-input — implementation complete + full suite 877 pass (uncommitted in worktree per contract); parked at ship sign-off
- question: https://github.com/PyAutoLabs/PyAutoArray/issues/372#issuecomment-4932908179
- autonomy: supervised effective (--auto chain 2026-07-09; bug cap binds over safe header; ship sign-off will park with question per contract)
- heart-ack: same 6-reason set as the assistant-ref-mechanics entry (in-session 2026-07-09); binds to exactly that set, any new reason parks
- note: consumers of edges_transformed = plot/inversion.py pcolormesh + mesh_geometry/rectangular_rotated.py — both inherit the fix; mcmc-corner-smoke (nightly blocker) queued in planned.md on autofit_workspace/PyAutoFit claims

## slacs1430-acs-parity
- issue: https://github.com/PyAutoLabs/PyAutoReduce/issues/17
- session: claude --resume cc79d958-a1aa-45cb-b088-bd6cae94aa86
- status: MERGED 2026-07-10 (0face12, squash; human-authorized in-session) — branches deleted; #17 stays OPEN for the parked model-parity leg only; entry retires to complete.md once that leg's verdict lands
- pr: https://github.com/PyAutoLabs/PyAutoReduce/pull/23
- resume(model-parity leg): `~/venv/PyAuto/bin/python prototypes/slacs1430_parity_fit.py autoreduce` then `... legacy` from PyAutoReduce root; compare fit_summary_*.json; verdict on #17
- note: acquire-dupe bug prompt RETIRED (fixed on main by #18's is_direct_product; my run disclosed on PR#23 as HAP-family); PJ011646 WFC3 follow-up prompt queued (methodology notes on #17)
- autonomy: safe effective (--auto launched 2026-07-09; plan human-approved in-session pre-launch; no heart-ack given)
- note: keck-ao pattern — analysis on PyAutoReduce main, NO worktree claim (frame-products holds it); outputs gitignored scripts/output/; script commit + PR gated until claim releases; autolens_assistant is driver-only (public template, no commits, scratch only)
- worktree: none (analysis on PyAutoReduce main; branch feature/slacs1430-acs-parity only at ship)

## keck-ao-acceptance-checks
- issue: https://github.com/PyAutoLabs/PyAutoReduce/issues/13
- status: parked-resumable (laptop reset) — check 3 done: plate-scale finding (adapter 9.942 wrong; 9.952 pre-2015/9.971 post; fix gated); check 4 fit CHECKPOINTED ~1h in (94MB checkpoint.hdf5); resume command on the issue's interim comment
- resume: re-run prototypes/b1938_lens_fit.py (Nautilus auto-resumes from output/b1938_keck_acceptance identity path); then report θ_E vs 0.45" on #13; then propose keck_ao.md parity appendix + epoch-aware native_scale adapter fix (present-and-wait)
- autonomy: default present-and-wait (no --auto); analysis read-only in prototypes/, doc/adapter edits gated on user review
- worktree: none (analysis on PyAutoReduce main; branch only if an edit is approved)

- session: claude --resume be7cb926-7874-4cc2-8c05-64c9644a64d9
- status: MERGED 2026-07-09 (371721f, squash) — human-directed merge in the keck-ao session (user authorized in-conversation); main checkout returned to main; PyAutoReduce claim released. Entry ready to retire to complete.md by its owning session (branch deletion via repo_cleanup)
- pr: https://github.com/PyAutoLabs/PyAutoReduce/pull/10
- notes: witnesses byte-identical both paths; 2 disclosed fix riders (CPDIS fobj, ePSF window +20) caught by baseline capture
- autonomy: default present-and-wait (refactor cap safe; no --auto given)

- autonomy: supervised (--auto, launched 2026-07-08, no heart-ack yet)

- campaign: local-CPU matrix in flight (background); interruption-safe — resume with
  sweep.py --skip-gpu --skip-existing (dense, then --sparse imaging pass), then

## morning-status-release-rehearsal
- issue: https://github.com/PyAutoLabs/PyAutoHeart/issues/39
- session: claude --resume ff9a8b2f-fda0-4bab-8962-1814843aa374
- status: RESOLVED 2026-07-09 (by session 5d58ef6a) — user re-set BOTH May-17 secrets (webhook + CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN); morning_health dispatched → Slack POST success; digest needed 3 more CI fixes on Mind main (checkout, show_full_output, allowedTools Write; 51e869e/d042289/0b78d5f) → fully green, delivered. Details: issues/39#issuecomment-4924031684. Entry ready to retire to complete.md by its owning session
- prs: PyAutoBuild#119 + PyAutoHeart#40 + PyAutoMind#41 (independent; merge Mind last is tidiest — its morning_health reads the others)
- post-merge: dispatch morning_health.yml on Mind main (Slack POST leg); flip vars.RELEASE_MODE=live on PyAutoBuild when satisfied (human)
- autonomy: human-required effective (release cap; --auto launched 2026-07-08, plan approved in-session; ship sign-off + merge human)
- cleanup 2026-07-09: worktree removed + feature branches (local+remote) deleted via /repo_cleanup — all PRs were merged; remaining leg (webhook secret + morning_health.yml dispatch) is human-only and needs no repo claim
