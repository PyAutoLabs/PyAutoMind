# Active Tasks

## benchmark-calibration
- issue: https://github.com/PyAutoLabs/autolens_assistant/issues/59
- status: workspace-dev — first calibration campaign: teacher × {sonnet, haiku} + easy × {sonnet} via claude-code-subagent harness, serial (memory); records → benchmarks/runs/, RESULTS.md regen, rubric verdict on issue; PR at end
- autonomy: supervised effective (human-directed launch 2026-07-10 in-conversation, continuing #57 --auto chain; heart-ack: same set as #58 ship, in-session)
- note: judge = claude-fable-5 (this session) for judged rows; operator replies honest/minimal via SendMessage; failures recorded
- worktree: none (in-place: autolens_assistant on feature/benchmark-calibration)
- repos:
  - autolens_assistant: feature/benchmark-calibration

## markdown-example-renderings
- issue: https://github.com/PyAutoLabs/PyAutoBuild/issues/134
- status: library-dev — build generate_markdown.py (execute curated scripts → nbconvert md + PNGs) in PyAutoBuild, then autolens pilot (root start_here + imaging five + guides trio); phase 2 (other dataset types/workspaces/HowTo) files as a new prompt at ship
- autonomy: safe effective (--auto launched 2026-07-10; docs ≤ medium after phasing; plan on issue; NO heart-ack given — any Heart YELLOW at ship parks)
- note: execution never TEST_MODE; modeling images via completed-run resume cache (first build pays one real sampling run); images committed — verify .gitignore doesn't swallow markdown/ outputs
- worktree: ~/Code/PyAutoLabs-wt/markdown-example-renderings
- repos:
  - PyAutoBuild: feature/markdown-example-renderings
  - autolens_workspace: feature/markdown-example-renderings

## preopt-breakdown-dashboard
- issue: https://github.com/PyAutoLabs/autolens_profiling/issues/59
- status: workspace-dev — imaging leg DONE 5/5 clean; HEADLINE: real >=~1.8x library slowdown on mesh cells since May (identical cell configs; confirmed vs phase-3 quiet-machine runtime; F-matrix ~50% everywhere); alma_high cells on retry (root cause = missing dataset + auto-simulate OOM; seeded 234MB from phase-3 wt); laptop numbers = ambient-load fallback tier; A100 leg dispatch-ready (15 submits, 3bb613a) but RAL GPU nodes DOWN
- campaign: driver scratchpad/breakdown_campaign.sh (session a66a757a), logs scratchpad/breakdown_logs/; interruption-safe — each cell's JSON persists to results/breakdown/ on completion; cold-resume = rerun remaining cells' commands from the driver (skip cells whose v-current JSON exists)
- autonomy: supervised effective (--auto launched 2026-07-10; header supervised binds over maintenance cap safe; plan on issue; no heart-ack given — any Heart YELLOW at ship parks)
- claim-override: human-directed 2026-07-10 — proceeds alongside profiling-preopt-campaign's autolens_profiling claim ("i dont see a clash"); phase 4 works likelihood_breakdown/ + README, phase 3 works likelihood_runtime/ — distinct paths; coordinate merge order at ship (README/build tooling may touch both — rebase on campaign branch if needed)
- note: dashboard deliverable depends on phase-3 PreOptimizationTimes runtime baseline (not yet tagged); breakdown runs (deliverable 1) proceed independently; HPC CPU/A100 legs gated on RAL availability

## pj011646-wfc3-parity
- issue: https://github.com/PyAutoLabs/PyAutoReduce/issues/25
- session: claude --resume cc79d958-a1aa-45cb-b088-bd6cae94aa86
- status: workspace-dev — phases 0-2 done (target=14653 F160W 5exp; DQ-512 blob hole -> bits-dial bug filed bug/pyautoreduce/wfc3_ir_dq_bits_dial.md, final_bits=512 workaround in script; orientation id-71.1deg corr 0.997; data ratio 1.016; noise x4.9 decomposed = R 2.39 x ours-conservative 1.58 x aris-underpredicts 1.3, aris map = 0.62x his own sky scatter; PSF 0.259 vs 0.202); phase 3 fits QUEUED behind free memory (watcher armed; laptop at 12/15GB from other sessions)
- autonomy: safe effective (--auto launched 2026-07-10; plan human-approved in-session pre-launch; no heart-ack given)
- note: keck-ao/slacs1430 pattern — analysis on PyAutoReduce main, NO worktree claim (jwst-frame-feasibility holds it); ship gated on claim release or human direction; autolens_assistant driver-only (in-place branch belongs to assistant-ref-mechanics — scratch writes only); model-parity fits SERIAL on quiet machine (~5.5GB)
- worktree: none (analysis on PyAutoReduce main; branch feature/pj011646-wfc3-parity only at ship)

## rect-adapt
- issue: https://github.com/PyAutoLabs/PyAutoArray/issues/372
- session: claude --resume 4bf88e6b-682d-4590-906f-77b68d059b26
- status: MERGED 2026-07-10 (human-directed via kernel-cdf session, coordinated order #375→#374; issue #372 closed with verification upthread) — entry ready to retire to complete.md by its owning session
- pr: https://github.com/PyAutoLabs/PyAutoArray/pull/375
- autonomy: supervised effective (--auto chain 2026-07-09; bug cap binds over safe header; ship sign-off will park with question per contract)
- heart-ack: same 6-reason set as the assistant-ref-mechanics entry (in-session 2026-07-09); binds to exactly that set, any new reason parks
- note: consumers of edges_transformed = plot/inversion.py pcolormesh + mesh_geometry/rectangular_rotated.py — both inherit the fix; mcmc-corner-smoke (nightly blocker) queued in planned.md on autofit_workspace/PyAutoFit claims

## slacs1430-acs-parity
- issue: https://github.com/PyAutoLabs/PyAutoReduce/issues/17
- session: claude --resume cc79d958-a1aa-45cb-b088-bd6cae94aa86
- status: MERGED 2026-07-10 (0face12, squash; human-authorized in-session) — branches deleted; #17 stays OPEN for the parked model-parity leg only; entry retires to complete.md once that leg's verdict lands
- pr: https://github.com/PyAutoLabs/PyAutoReduce/pull/23
- resume(model-parity leg): `~/venv/PyAuto/bin/python prototypes/slacs1430_parity_fit.py autoreduce` then `... legacy` from PyAutoReduce root; compare fit_summary_*.json; verdict on #17
- note: acquire-dupe bug prompt RETIRED (fixed on main by #18's is_direct_product; my run disclosed on PR#23 as HAP-family); PJ011646 WFC3 follow-up prompt queued (methodology notes on #17)
- autonomy: safe effective (--auto launched 2026-07-09; plan human-approved in-session pre-launch; no heart-ack given)
- note: keck-ao pattern — analysis on PyAutoReduce main, NO worktree claim (frame-products holds it); outputs gitignored scripts/output/; script commit + PR gated until claim releases; autolens_assistant is driver-only (public template, no commits, scratch only)
- worktree: none (analysis on PyAutoReduce main; branch feature/slacs1430-acs-parity only at ship)
- repos:

## keck-ao-acceptance-checks
- issue: https://github.com/PyAutoLabs/PyAutoReduce/issues/13
- status: parked-resumable (laptop reset) — check 3 done: plate-scale finding (adapter 9.942 wrong; 9.952 pre-2015/9.971 post; fix gated); check 4 fit CHECKPOINTED ~1h in (94MB checkpoint.hdf5); resume command on the issue's interim comment
- resume: re-run prototypes/b1938_lens_fit.py (Nautilus auto-resumes from output/b1938_keck_acceptance identity path); then report θ_E vs 0.45" on #13; then propose keck_ao.md parity appendix + epoch-aware native_scale adapter fix (present-and-wait)
- autonomy: default present-and-wait (no --auto); analysis read-only in prototypes/, doc/adapter edits gated on user review
- worktree: none (analysis on PyAutoReduce main; branch only if an edit is approved)
- repos:

## refactor-post-phase3
- issue: https://github.com/PyAutoLabs/PyAutoReduce/issues/8
- session: claude --resume be7cb926-7874-4cc2-8c05-64c9644a64d9
- status: MERGED 2026-07-09 (371721f, squash) — human-directed merge in the keck-ao session (user authorized in-conversation); main checkout returned to main; PyAutoReduce claim released. Entry ready to retire to complete.md by its owning session (branch deletion via repo_cleanup)
- pr: https://github.com/PyAutoLabs/PyAutoReduce/pull/10
- notes: witnesses byte-identical both paths; 2 disclosed fix riders (CPDIS fobj, ePSF window +20) caught by baseline capture
- autonomy: default present-and-wait (refactor cap safe; no --auto given)
- worktree: released (was in-place)

## profiling-preopt-campaign
- issue: https://github.com/PyAutoLabs/autolens_profiling/issues/56
- status: workspace-dev
- autonomy: supervised (--auto, launched 2026-07-08; local-CPU leg, RAL down)
- campaign: local-CPU matrix in flight (background); interruption-safe — resume with
  sweep.py --skip-gpu --skip-existing (dense, then --sparse imaging pass), then
  aggregate.py; full cold-resume steps on the issue (comment of 2026-07-08 evening)

## morning-status-release-rehearsal
- issue: https://github.com/PyAutoLabs/PyAutoHeart/issues/39
- session: claude --resume ff9a8b2f-fda0-4bab-8962-1814843aa374
- status: RESOLVED 2026-07-09 (by session 5d58ef6a) — user re-set BOTH May-17 secrets (webhook + CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN); morning_health dispatched → Slack POST success; digest needed 3 more CI fixes on Mind main (checkout, show_full_output, allowedTools Write; 51e869e/d042289/0b78d5f) → fully green, delivered. Details: issues/39#issuecomment-4924031684. Entry ready to retire to complete.md by its owning session
- prs: PyAutoBuild#119 + PyAutoHeart#40 + PyAutoMind#41 (independent; merge Mind last is tidiest — its morning_health reads the others)
- post-merge: dispatch morning_health.yml on Mind main (Slack POST leg); flip vars.RELEASE_MODE=live on PyAutoBuild when satisfied (human)
- autonomy: human-required effective (release cap; --auto launched 2026-07-08, plan approved in-session; ship sign-off + merge human)
- cleanup 2026-07-09: worktree removed + feature branches (local+remote) deleted via /repo_cleanup — all PRs were merged; remaining leg (webhook secret + morning_health.yml dispatch) is human-only and needs no repo claim

## multi-shared-state-examples-phase-1-design
- issue: https://github.com/PyAutoLabs/PyAutoLens/issues/599
- session: (this CLI session, 2026-07-10)
- status: library-dev
- worktree: none — design-only phase (deliverable = design note + locked API sketch on the issue; no source edits)
- repos:
- notes: Phase 1/4 of feature/autolens/multi_shared_state_examples (parent + phase-1 prompts in issued/; phases 2-4 prompts staged in feature/autolens/, deliberately un-issued). Claims no repos, so it does not conflict with kernel-forward-chunking / rect-adapt (PyAutoArray) or markdown-example-renderings (autolens_workspace); those claims matter from Phase 2 on.
- status-update 2026-07-10: DESIGN DELIVERED — decisions D1-D6 posted as the design-note comment on #599 (shared object = source-plane mesh geometry + H on AbstractPreloads; same-lambda = shared-mesh-per-factor now, joint stacked inversion as explicit follow-up prompt multi_joint_stack_inversion; shifts via existing aa.DatasetModel, known-by-default). Phase 2-3 prompts updated with the locked decisions. AWAITING user review of D2 especially ("one source" = per-factor-on-identical-mesh now, literal joint solve deferred) before issuing Phase 2 and closing #599's phase-1 leg.

## multi-shared-state-core-api
- issue: https://github.com/PyAutoLabs/PyAutoArray/issues/379
- session: (this CLI session, 2026-07-10)
- status: library-dev
- worktree: ~/Code/PyAutoLabs-wt/multi-shared-state-core-api
- repos:
  - PyAutoArray
  - PyAutoLens
- autonomy: safe effective (feature/medium, --auto granted by user 2026-07-10; plan on issue #379; four-leg ship gate; ends at PR-open, merge human)
- conflict-override: PyAutoArray claims kernel-forward-chunking + rect-adapt verified zero file overlap (both touch only inversion/mesh/ kernel-CDF files; this task touches preloads/ + imaging analysis) — proceeding in a fresh worktree rather than parking in planned.md
- epic: phase 2/4 of multi_shared_state_examples (design locked on PyAutoLens#599 incl. H-removal amendment)
