# Epics

Long-running multi-phase programmes — work that is bigger than any one task
and outlives any single issue. Each entry names the epic's canonical
**ledger**: the file that holds its phase/gate state, wherever it lives. The
dashboard renders these under In flight with a one-tap resume prompt that
works out where the epic stands from its ledger and continues it from the
next logical point — nobody should have to hunt for the issue that pairs
with an epic's current phase.

Schema per entry: `## <slug>` then `- title:` / `- ledger:` / `- notes:`
(and optionally `- status:` for a coarse, durable state — never per-phase
detail, which belongs in the ledger).

A member prompt declares its membership in its own header: `Epic: <slug>`
(this file's slug) plus an optional `Phase: <n>`. The dashboard then keeps
members out of the pick lists and work-type sections and shows them only
grouped, phase-ordered, under their epic — worked in order through the
epic, never picked standalone.

## jax-inference-profiling
- title: JAX profiling — inference programme
- ledger: autolens_profiling/results/notes/inference/PROGRAMME.md
- notes: DECISIONS.md (append-only gate log) and phase_<NN>_*/RESULTS.md sit beside the ledger; slices ship as autolens_profiling issues/PRs, not Mind prompts.

## cluster-strong-lensing
- title: Cluster strong lensing — Source & Cluster arc
- ledger: draft/feature/autolens/source_cluster_arc.md
- notes: 12 phased prompts under draft/; issue phases ONE at a time as predecessors near shipping — no bulk issue queues.

## jax-compile-stall
- title: Intermittent XLA compile stall in the JAX vmap likelihood path
- ledger: draft/bug/ci/jax_vmap_jit_compile_stall.md
- status: IN FLIGHT — reopened 2026-08-27 by phase 3 (PyAutoFit#1528, task jax-stall-block-until-ready).
  Was CLOSED AS PARTIAL 2026-08-23 — record complete/2026/08/jax-compile-stall-slow-vs-stall-audit.md
- NEW EVIDENCE 2026-08-25: multi_dataset/jax_likelihood/shared_preloads.py stalled at TIMEOUT (300s) in
  PyAutoHeart Workspace Smoke run 32902243623 — one day after the 2026-08-24 retime refuted its SLOW
  marker and returned it to mega-run coverage. N=5 per leg measures the fast mode of a bimodal failure
  and says nothing about the tail, so every entry that sweep readmitted carries the same uncertainty.
  Also the epic's first occurrence via the weekly workspace-validation channel (cross-harness
  corroboration), and smoke_tests.txt vs no_run.yaml now disagree about this script. Nothing parked.
  See the ledger's "New occurrence — 2026-08-25" section; surfaced by
  complete/2026/08/weekly-smoke-timings-naming.md.
- CORRECTION (post-close-out): the captured stack shows the hang is in jax.block_until_ready, NOT in
  compilation. The epic's name and every marker calling this an "XLA compile stall" are wrong. Resume
  from "why does block_until_ready never return", not from compiler behaviour.
- notes: phase 1 (watchdog) shipped in full; phases 2/3 stopped deliberately at a measured-but-not-root-caused state. The stall is instrumented and characterised (>100x bimodality inside one compile step; vmap-of-jit contributory at p=0.070 but NOT causal; the compile-cache hypothesis never tested) and NOTHING was un-quarantined. Resumed 2026-08-27 as phase 3 (PyAutoFit#1528) — NOT via draft/research/ci/smoke_timing_and_profiling.md,
  which the 2026-08-23 close-out named as the resume door but which was never written. Superseded complete/2026/08/multi-dataset-jax-likelihood-xla-stall.md (was draft/bug/autolens_workspace_test/multi_dataset_jax_likelihood_xla_stall.md).

## graphical-ep
- title: Expectation propagation (EP) campaign
- ledger: draft/research/graphical_ep/ep_campaign.md
- notes: umbrella phase map — each phase's real content lives in its own prompt under draft/research/graphical_ep/; the campaign file itself is never issued.
