# Deep research: Can we speed up Delaunay in PyAutoArray?

## UPDATE 2026-05-16 — status of the alternatives

The picture has narrowed sharply since this doc was written. Two of the
candidate levers have been resolved, and the practical recommendation is
now option **A**, despite its modest measured speedup (~1.2× — see below).

### kNN-barycentric wildcard (F-variant in the original plan): FAILED

- Library PR: https://github.com/PyAutoLabs/PyAutoArray/pull/318
- Developer regression: https://github.com/PyAutoLabs/autolens_workspace_developer/pull/70
- Smoke: https://github.com/PyAutoLabs/autolens_workspace_test/pull/99
- Negative-result summary on issue: https://github.com/PyAutoLabs/PyAutoArray/issues/317

Result at the HST imaging fiducial: `log_evidence = 26872.33` vs
Delaunay's `26288.32` — **2.22% drift, fails even rtol=1e-2** (the
abandon threshold from the gate decision tree).

**Root cause is structural, not numerical**: ~5% of mesh vertices
(60/1291) are *never* in any query's nearest-3 nor in any split-point's
nearest-3. They're paid for at mesh-construction time and discarded.
Delaunay's triangulation guarantees every vertex belongs to at least
one simplex — kNN topology makes no such guarantee, and that gap is what
breaks the science. This is a topology issue (which the original F-variant
section didn't consider), not a weight-quality issue, so retrying with
different kernels (Wendland → barycentric → other) cannot recover it.

The infrastructure shipped as additive library code: `aa.mesh.KNNBarycentric`
exists in the repo (8 unit tests), but it should not be used for production
science. The regression script in `autolens_workspace_developer` pins
the observed `log_evidence` as a regression catch and prints the FAILED
verdict block at the end of each run.

**Implication for this doc**: the F-variant subsection below is
superseded by the negative result above. Approaches based on kernel-only
or kNN-only weighting (without a triangulation-style guarantee that
every mesh vertex is reachable) will hit the same structural ceiling.

### Option A (split the callback): ALREADY IMPLEMENTED, SHELVED

- Shelved doc: `PyAutoPrompt/shelved/delaunay_jax_find_simplex_split.md`
- Branch (pushed): `feature/delaunay-jax-find-simplex` on `PyAutoLabs/PyAutoArray`
- Commit: `eda747c2` (2026-05-11)
- Code: ready-to-ship (488 LOC, validated 0/15361 disagreements vs scipy)

The measured speedup at production batch=20 on A100 fp64 was
**disappointing relative to this doc's projection**:

| Config | full_pipeline ms/elem | speedup |
|---|---:|---:|
| Baseline (current main) | 69.5 | 1.00× |
| `delaunay_jax_find_simplex=true` | 58.27 | **1.19×** |
| + `delaunay_scipy_pool_workers=4` | 56.67 | **1.23×** |
| + `delaunay_scipy_pool_workers=8` | 60.35 | 1.15× (worse — IPC saturates) |

The original doc projected 1.4× from A alone and 1.5–1.8× combined with
B. Actual numbers came in at ~1.2× combined, because:
- find_simplex on A100 GPU was already faster than projected, so the
  saving over scipy was smaller than expected (~11 ms/element, not the
  projected ~13 ms).
- scipy.Delaunay per call is ~3–5 ms — small enough that process-pool
  IPC overhead (~1–2 ms per dispatch) eats most of the parallelism gain
  at batch=20.
- pool_workers=8 is *slower* than pool_workers=4 — diminishing returns
  set in fast.

A was shelved on 2026-05-11 specifically because the wildcard
(kNN-barycentric) was considered a higher-payoff bet — if the wildcard
worked, it would have obsoleted A entirely by eliminating scipy from the
hot path. **The wildcard has now failed, so A's 1.19× becomes the
recommended next ship**: it's the only realistic JAX-native lever that
preserves Delaunay's science guarantees.

### Recommended next action

**Resume option A.** The code is ready; remaining work is roughly half
a day (per the shelved doc's "Steps to resume and ship"):
- End-to-end `log_evidence` validation at `rtol=1e-4` on the HST
  imaging + SMA interferometer fiducials with the flag on
- Workspace smoke (`autolens_workspace_test/scripts/jax_assertions/nnls.py`)
- Default decision (flag-on by default if rtol=1e-4 passes; opt-in if
  only rtol=1e-3 passes)
- Open the PR

Issue this as a new prompt (`autoarray/delaunay_jax_find_simplex_resume.md`
or similar) when ready.

### Option B (spatial hash) — only if A's 1.19× isn't enough

The original doc lists "spatial-hash + brute-force on cell candidates"
as a 10× improvement over A's brute-force point location. At A100
production scale where A's find_simplex is already ~11 ms saved,
B's 10× on top would save another ~10 ms → realistic ~1.3–1.4× full
pipeline (versus baseline). Worth pursuing *after* A ships and the
production speedup has been measured at the real likelihood scale — not
before, because the gain may be smaller than projected for the same
reason A's was (GPU brute-force is already fast enough that
spatial-acceleration saves less than projected).

Implementation cost: maybe a week. Requires careful padding to keep
JAX shapes static across batch elements. **Not recommended now** —
only revisit if A ships, gets measured at production, and falls short
of the speedup target.

### Original analysis preserved below for context

The cost decomposition, the approach catalogue (A–G), and the validation
gates all remain accurate. The recommended action plan at the bottom is
superseded by this update.

---

**Bottom line up front (original)**: yes, by 2-5× without changing the science.
The lever isn't pure-JAX Delaunay (basically infeasible) — it's
**splitting the scipy callback in two**: keep scipy for triangulation
(small, fast), and move `find_simplex` point location to a JAX-native
implementation that vmaps across the batch.

A secondary lever is multiprocessing the scipy callback. Combined,
realistic speedup is 3-5× on the Delaunay-specific cost, which translates
to ~1.5-1.8× on the full production likelihood at batch=20.

(Measured: 1.19×–1.23× at batch=20 on A100 fp64. See update above.)

## What is actually inside the 16.87 ms/element scipy callback

Decomposed via pure-Python `scipy.spatial.Delaunay` timing at production
size (1231 mesh pts, 15361 query pts) on a laptop CPU:

| Sub-call | Laptop ms | Share | Notes |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| `Delaunay(mesh)` build | 5.7 ms | ~14% | Triangulation only — cheap |
| `tri.find_simplex(data_grid)` | 20.6 ms | ~52% | Point location — dominant |
| `tri.find_simplex(split_points)` | ~20 ms | ~52% | **Called twice** in scipy_delaunay() — once for the data grid, once for split-cross-points for regularization |
| Misc (split_points construction, area_factor, padding) | ~5 ms | ~13% | Small |

Wait — this adds to >100%, because two find_simplex calls overlap with
the share. Re-stated: the scipy callback runs **one Delaunay build + two
find_simplex calls + some array padding**. The two find_simplex calls
together are >50% of scipy's work.

HPC A100 (server-grade CPU, single core via `--cpus-per-task=4` but
scipy is single-threaded): 16.87 ms per element. Same shape, faster CPU.

**Conclusion: the scipy callback is point-location-bound, not
triangulation-bound.** `find_simplex` is what scales with the data grid
size (15361 query points), and we have two of them.

## Approach catalogue, ranked by ROI

### A. Split triangulation from point location (HIGH ROI, MEDIUM EFFORT)

**Idea**: keep scipy.Delaunay (small, fast, CPU is fine for K=1231 pts).
Replace `tri.find_simplex(query_points)` with a JAX-native implementation
of point-in-triangle search that vmaps cleanly across the batch.

**JAX implementation options** for point location:

1. **Brute-force vectorised**. For each query point, test against all
   2N=2462 triangles using barycentric coordinates. The query is inside
   triangle i iff all three barycentric coordinates of i are non-negative.
   - Cost: Q × T × 3 multiplications per element = 15361 × 2462 × 3 ≈
     1.1e8 ops. On A100 fp64 (~10 TFLOPS) that's ~10 µs theoretical, ~1-2 ms
     realistic. Under vmap=20: ~30 ms wall.
   - Far cheaper than scipy's 20 ms sequential per element × 20 = 400 ms wall.

2. **Spatial-hash + brute-force on cell candidates**. Divide source-plane
   bounding box into a fine regular grid. For each grid cell, list the
   triangles overlapping it (precomputed once per Delaunay build).
   Per-query: hash to cell, brute-force the small candidate list.
   - Cost: ~10× faster than approach (1) for typical grids.
   - More complex to implement; needs careful padding to keep shapes
     static for JAX.

3. **Walk-based search** from a guess triangle. Classical CGAL approach.
   - Inherently sequential per query; doesn't vmap.
   - Avoid.

**Recommended**: approach (1) for simplicity. It's already 10-20× faster
than scipy's two find_simplex calls under vmap=20, and the code is short.

**Expected saving on full pipeline at batch=20**:
- Current: 16.87 ms × 20 = 337 ms wall on scipy_delaunay
- With this approach: triangulation 3 ms × 20 = 60 ms wall (still
  sequential pure_callback) + brute-force point loc 30 ms wall (JAX, vmap-parallel)
  + misc 20 ms = ~110 ms wall per batched call
- **Saving: ~227 ms per batched call**, full pipeline per element drops
  from 69.5 → ~58 ms, **batch_time 1.4 sec → 1.0 sec (~1.4× speedup)**.

**Risks**:
- Barycentric point-in-triangle on degenerate triangles needs care
  (numerical tolerance at edges). scipy/Qhull handles this with robust
  predicates.
- `tri.find_simplex` returns -1 for query points OUTSIDE the convex hull.
  Need equivalent handling in JAX — easy with a "max barycentric < 0" check.

**Why this works**: Delaunay's triangulation is a small problem (~1231
points). The scaling pain is in the 15361 query points, and that part
is embarrassingly parallel — exactly what JAX/GPU is good at.

### B. Multiprocessing the scipy callback (LOW EFFORT, MODEST GAIN)

**Idea**: replace the lambda inside `jax.pure_callback` with one that
spawns N processes (where N = batch_size) and runs scipy.Delaunay in
parallel. Persistent worker pool to avoid spawn overhead.

**Implementation sketch**:
```python
from concurrent.futures import ProcessPoolExecutor
_pool = ProcessPoolExecutor(max_workers=8)
def parallel_scipy_delaunay(points_batched, qpts_batched, areas_factor):
    futs = [_pool.submit(scipy_delaunay, p, q, areas_factor)
            for p, q in zip(points_batched, qpts_batched)]
    return [f.result() for f in futs]
```

Plus: change `vmap_method="sequential"` to `"parallel"` AND wrap so the
callback receives the full batch at once.

**Caveats**:
- scipy uses Qhull which has global state in C — but processes have
  separate address spaces, so multiprocessing is safe (threading is not).
- IPC overhead per batch element: ~1 ms each way → 2-3 ms per element
  baseline.
- Process pool startup: do it once, not per-call.

**Expected saving at batch=20**:
- Current: 337 ms wall (sequential)
- With 8 parallel workers: 337/8 + IPC overhead ≈ 45-60 ms wall
- **Saving: ~280 ms per batched call**, similar to approach A.

**Risks**:
- Process pool lifecycle in JAX context (forking under JIT? probably fine
  since pure_callback hands off cleanly)
- Memory: each process loads its own scipy, ~few hundred MB × 8 = ~few GB
- HPC SLURM `--cpus-per-task=N` must be at least 8 to use 8 workers

**Combines additively with approach A**: if A reduces scipy work to just
the triangulation (~3 ms/element), multiprocessing makes it 0.5 ms wall.

### C. Pure-JAX Delaunay (LOW ROI, VERY HIGH EFFORT)

**Status**: I assessed this carefully. Verdict: **not realistically
achievable for production within reasonable engineering budget.**

Why:
1. **Dynamic output shape.** Delaunay produces a triangulation whose
   size depends on point distribution (typically 2N-2-h triangles for N
   points where h is hull size). JAX requires static shapes. Workaround:
   pad to 2N. Adds complexity.
2. **Sequential algorithms.** Bowyer-Watson incremental insertion is
   intrinsically sequential. Implementable with `lax.scan` but each step
   has dynamic control flow (which triangles to flip).
3. **Numerical robustness.** Qhull uses exact arithmetic on geometric
   predicates (incircle, orient2d) — degenerate point configurations
   are common, and floating-point predicates fail catastrophically
   (returning inconsistent triangulations that crash downstream). JAX
   has no robust geometric predicates library.
4. **Existing parallel Delaunay** (gDel2D, JCFlip, etc.) is CUDA, not JAX.
   Wrapping via XLA custom-call is possible but complex; you'd be back
   to a `pure_callback`-like sync barrier and lose the JAX advantage.

**Effort estimate**: 2-6 months of research-grade work to get a robust
implementation. Almost certainly slower than scipy in practice (scipy/Qhull
is heavily optimized C).

**Don't go this route.** The pure-JAX *dream* is what makes you think
this is necessary, but the bottleneck isn't really the triangulation —
it's the point location and the synchronous CPU callback. Both are
addressable without solving the pure-JAX Delaunay problem.

### D. Cache topology across nearby parameter samples (MEDIUM ROI, HIGH EFFORT)

**Idea**: nested sampling proposes correlated points. If consecutive
parameter vectors give source-plane meshes that differ by less than the
local mesh spacing, the triangulation connectivity is the same — only
the coordinates change. Cache the simplices, re-do find_simplex.

**Implementation**: sampler-level, in PyAutoFit's `fitness._vmap`. Pass
a hint to the likelihood (e.g., "this batch is close to the previous;
reuse triangulation"). Within `inversion_util.reconstruction_positive_only_from`,
check the hint and skip scipy.Delaunay if valid.

**Expected saving**: depends on cache hit rate. Nautilus's nested sampling
typically has high spatial correlation in proposals when narrowing — 50-80%
hit rate plausible. If 70%, saving is 0.7 × 5 ms / element on triangulation
+ no saving on point location. **Net: ~3 ms/element. Small.**

**Risks**:
- Wrong triangulation if the lens model changes catastrophically — caustic
  crossings, source intersecting the lens, etc. Would silently corrupt the
  likelihood.
- Complex API: requires PyAutoFit changes to thread the cache hint.

**Don't prioritise** — small gain, complex change, risk of silent bugs.

### E. External GPU Delaunay via pure_callback (UNCLEAR ROI, HIGH EFFORT)

**Idea**: replace scipy.Delaunay with a GPU library (gDel2D, cuDelaunay)
via `pure_callback`. Eliminates the CPU bottleneck.

**Status**:
- gDel2D, JCFlip, etc. exist as research-grade CUDA. Maintenance and
  Python bindings are uncertain.
- Even on GPU, the dispatch is via pure_callback → device-to-host-to-device
  transfer + library invocation overhead. Worth ~10-20 µs per call but
  still synchronous.
- vmap_method="sequential" still applies. To benefit, would need to write
  a batched GPU Delaunay call.

**Worth a literature scan** before committing — see if any maintained
JAX-compatible Delaunay library exists. If so, low effort. If not,
binding work is high.

### F. Improve InterpolatorKNearestNeighbor (LOW EFFORT, BOUNDED BY SCIENCE)

**Status**: this exists at `autoarray/inversion/mesh/interpolator/knn.py`
and is **already pure JAX** (no scipy callback). It uses brute-force kNN
via `lax.fori_loop` over blocks of mesh points + Wendland C4 kernel
weighting.

**Why it's scientifically worse than Delaunay**:
- kNN ignores local triangulation structure. At source-plane density
  gradients (which adapt meshes have), kNN smooths across mesh density
  boundaries; Delaunay respects them via the triangle connectivity.
- Wendland kernel + radius_scale is a global knob. Delaunay's barycentric
  weights are locally exact.
- At caustic crossings (where source positions fold), kNN smears across
  the fold; Delaunay's triangulation handles it via the new
  triangles spanning the fold.

**Performance under vmap=20 (estimated, not measured here)**: probably
2-5 ms per element on A100 — much faster than scipy's 16.87 ms.

**Quality tuning to consider**:
- `k_neighbors` — increase to 5-7 (default may be 3)? Smoother but slower.
- `radius_scale` — adapt per-query-point based on local density? Currently
  global.
- Use the THREE closest mesh points and barycentric-interpolate among
  those three (essentially fake-Delaunay) instead of Wendland weights.
  **This is interesting** — it gives you Delaunay-like locality without
  scipy.

**Worth testing**: the kNN-with-barycentric-on-3 idea is a low-effort
experiment. If it gives log-evidence within rtol=1e-4 of Delaunay across
the production pipelines, it could replace Delaunay entirely. Even if
not, it's a useful fallback for environments where Delaunay is too slow.

### G. Eliminate the second find_simplex (LOW EFFORT, GUARANTEED ~10% SAVING)

**Idea**: scipy_delaunay() calls `find_simplex` twice — once on the
data grid (~20 ms) and once on split_points (~10 ms — split_points is
4×1231 = 4924 points). The second is for ConstantSplit regularization.

If the production pipelines don't use ConstantSplit (or use it less
hot-path-critically), the second find_simplex is wasted work.

**Investigation**: check which regularization is in use at production
fiducial. If not ConstantSplit, skip the second find_simplex.

**Expected saving**: ~3-5 ms/element at batch=20 → ~60-100 ms wall per
batched call. **About 5-7% on the full pipeline.**

This is a free win regardless of any other change.

## Recommended action plan

**Phase 1** (low effort, ~1-3 days):
- **G.** Audit whether the second find_simplex is needed at production
  fiducial. Make it conditional on regularization scheme. Free 5-7%.
- **F (variant).** Add a "kNN with barycentric-on-3-nearest" mode to
  InterpolatorKNearestNeighbor. Test log-evidence against Delaunay on
  the cross-pipeline matrix at rtol=1e-4. If it passes, it's a
  drop-in JAX-friendly replacement.

**Phase 2** (medium effort, ~1-2 weeks):
- **A.** Implement the split: scipy for triangulation, JAX brute-force
  for point location. Validate log-evidence matches scipy at rtol=1e-6.
- **B.** Add multiprocessing wrapper around the (now-small) scipy
  callback. Persistent process pool initialised at first use.

**Phase 2 expected impact**: combined 3-5× on Delaunay-specific cost,
~1.5-1.8× on the full likelihood at batch=20.

**Phase 3** (optional, only if Phase 2 isn't enough):
- **D.** Sampler-level caching. Significant complexity for modest gain.
  Only if science throughput is still the bottleneck after Phase 2.

## What this task is NOT

- Not a pure-JAX Delaunay project. That's a research dead end.
- Not an "improve scipy" project — scipy is fine; the issue is callback
  topology.
- Not an algorithm-replacement project — we keep Delaunay's scientific
  properties (triangulation, barycentric interpolation, split-points for
  regularization). We change WHERE the work happens, not WHAT the work is.

## Files touched

Phase 1 (G):
- `autoarray/inversion/mesh/interpolator/delaunay.py:scipy_delaunay` —
  conditional second find_simplex based on a parameter
- `autoarray/inversion/mesh/interpolator/delaunay.py:jax_delaunay` —
  same kwarg
- Caller: `_mappings_sizes_weights_split` in the InterpolatorDelaunay
  class checks regularization type before requesting split-points data

Phase 1 (F variant):
- `autoarray/inversion/mesh/interpolator/knn.py` — add a `use_barycentric`
  mode that picks top-3 and uses barycentric coords instead of Wendland
- Maybe new class `InterpolatorKNNBarycentric` if cleaner

Phase 2 (A):
- New module `autoarray/inversion/mesh/interpolator/delaunay_jax_locate.py`
  — JAX implementation of brute-force barycentric point location
- `delaunay.py:scipy_delaunay` simplified to triangulation only
- `delaunay.py:jax_delaunay` — orchestration: pure_callback for
  triangulation, JAX-native for point location

Phase 2 (B):
- `delaunay.py` — wrap the pure_callback host function with a process
  pool. Add a `--max-workers` config option to `autoarray/config/general.yaml`.

## Validation gates for any change

1. **Log-evidence regression**: `EXPECTED_LOG_EVIDENCE_HST` (Delaunay
   at MGE-60) and `EXPECTED_LOG_EVIDENCE_SMA` (interferometer) must
   hold at rtol=1e-4 fp64.
2. **Reconstruction-vector L2**: source-pixel coefficients must match
   current main at rtol=1e-6 on the canonical pipelines.
3. **Cross-pipeline matrix**: all 6 pipelines (imaging mge/rect/delaunay,
   interferometer mge/rect/delaunay) pass their regression assertions.
4. **Performance gates**: A100 batch=20 vmap-per-call ≤ 50 ms (down from
   69.5 ms baseline). Stretch goal: ≤ 40 ms.
5. **autolens_workspace_test `jax_assertions/nnls.py`** still passes
   (well-conditioned match + ill-conditioned finite-gradient).
